- 👋 Hi, I’m @LuiyiBarrantes
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in programming in Arduino, as well as web and mobile applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web programming in javascript language, with HTML and CSS structure, and the kanban and scrum framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deal with some solution to problems related to the interface between inexperienced users or with little 
- knowledge in the use of the different technologies that the internet provides, even if they are different types of procedures with government or private institutions, 
- and that can be universalize the use of different technological platforms.
